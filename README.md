# Biological-Databases-BENG-182-
This repository contains code from my Biological Databses course where I coded Bioinformatics command line tools including programs for sequence alignment, 
pattern matching, and CpG island prediction. Each assignment folder contains a pdf file of the questions/instructions as well as the corresponding code files.
